# MsCThesis - Daniel Baptista Andrade

MSc Thesis Daniel Andrade - Renewable Energy Communities using blockchain for its foundation and peer-to-peer energy exchange.

This repository serves as a complement to other architecture repositories and only possesses code related to obtaining results.
Here you can find the different scripts and logs used and generated that were used to achieve the Results chapter from my dissertation.
- The contracts folder contains the different smart contract alternatives tested
- The device Scripts folder has the different files that reside inside a Raspberry Pi attached to an electricity meter and only contains the second phase of the REC architecture flow (receiving and processing payments using Hedera Hashgraph)
- The helpers folder contains code responsible for interaction with the different contracts
- The metrics folder contains code for processing the different logs and data and creating charts accordingly as well as other important metrics.


 The results can be viewed in detail in the *MScThesisDanielAndrade* file as well as the other chapters of the Thesis.
