The BUSY error happens when the network gets congested with other users and the throttle has reached its limit. You'll have to wait until the network is no longer congested to complete any transactions.
If you are on testnet consider running a local instance to continue testing. Its highly encouraged to use a local node for development.
Here is a tutorial on how to set up your own local node. https://hedera.com/blog/how-to-set-up-your-own-hedera-local-network-using-docker
